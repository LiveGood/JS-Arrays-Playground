# JS-Arrays-Playground
A lightweight library similar to lodash/underscore only for working on arrays. 

**Plan:**
  1. Add all array methods which exist on Array.prototype
  2. Add more useful methods from lodash and ramda
  3. Add my own functions
    - All array sort algorithms
    - deep search in multi dimensional arrays
